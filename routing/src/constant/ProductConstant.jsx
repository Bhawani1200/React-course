        description: "Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream Dry is a daily cream specially formulated to provide intensive hydration to dry and sensitive skin. You can apply it to the face, hands, feet, elbows, knees - basically anywhere where the skin needs intensive hydration. To begin with, it has a unique formula. Glycerin has the ability to attract water and bind it to the skin. Niacinamide leads to better skin hydration and a healthier skin barrier. And Panthenol hydrates, softens and soothes the skin. In essence, it can not only deeply hydrate and nourish the skin but also promote a healthier skin barrier enhancing skin protection against daily aggressions. In addition, its rich texture is easy to spread, leaving no feeling of greasiness, and is rapidly absorbed.",
